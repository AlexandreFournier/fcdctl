Simple command line interface for the Funcube Dongle Pro and Pro+


Installing

Ensure that you have libusb-1.0 installed (including the -devel or -dev
package) then run "make" or "make fcdpp" without the quotes in the terminal.
You should end up with an application called "fcdctl". Copy this to a location
of your choice.

If you don't already have the udev rule file installed, install it now:

$ sudo cp funcube-dongle.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/68-funcube-dongle.rules

or if you have a Funcube Dongle Pro+:

$ sudo cp funcube-dongle-proplus.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/68-funcube-dongle-proplus.rules

Re-insert your dongle and you should now be able to use fcdctl.
